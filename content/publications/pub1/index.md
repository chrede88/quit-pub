title: Gate-tunable Josephson diode in proximitized InAs supercurrent interferometers
subtitle: Phys. Rev. Research 5, 033131 (2023)
summary: The Josephson diode (JD) is a nonreciprocal circuit element that supports a larger critical current in one direction compared to the other. This effect has gained growing interest because of promising applications in superconducting electronic circuits with low power consumption. Some implementations of a JD rely on breaking the inversion symmetry in the material used to realize Josephson junctions (JJs), but recent theoretical proposals have suggested that the effect can also be engineered by combining two JJs hosting highly transmitting Andreev bound states in a Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID) at a small, but finite flux bias. We have realized a SQUID with two JJs fabricated in a proximitized InAs two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG). We demonstrate gate control of the diode efficiency from zero up to around 30% at specific flux bias values which comes close to the maximum of ∼40% predicated in Souto et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 129, 267702 (2022)]. The key ingredients to the JD effect in the SQUID arrangement is the presence of highly transmitting channels in the JJs, a flux bias, and an asymmetry between the two SQUID arms.

takes into account the numerically simulated loop inductances, their asymmetry, and the values Ic(1,2) of the two junctions obtained from
the measurements in Fig. 1(c). The JJ transparencies were fixed to τ∗ =τ∗ = 0.86.(a)|η|asafunctionofV atfixedV ,and(b)|η| 12 G2G1
